# State-Based Overtime Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ State-Based Overtime Logic
**Problem**: Pro plan users weren't getting individual employee state-based overtime calculations.
**Solution**: 
- Added `OvertimeType` configuration setting with 3 options:
  - `manual` - Manual overtime settings (default)
  - `company_state` - Use company's state overtime rules
  - `employee_state` - Use each employee's individual state (Pro plan only)
- Modified `ShowPayroll.java` and `PayrollServlet.java` to check `OvertimeType` setting
- Only applies state rules when `OvertimeType = "employee_state"` AND tenant has Pro plan

### 2. ✅ Payroll Page Refresh
**Problem**: When clicking employee in payroll to edit punches, page didn't refresh when modal closed.
**Solution**: 
- Modified `payroll.js` to detect when punch edit popup closes
- Added automatic page refresh when popup window is closed
- Maintains existing auto-close timer functionality

### 3. ✅ Settings Page Pro Plan Option
**Problem**: No UI option for Pro plan users to select employee state-based overtime.
**Solution**:
- Added third overtime type option: "By Employee State" with PRO badge
- Only shows for Pro plan users (100 max users)
- Updated settings page JSP, CSS, and JavaScript
- Added Pro badge styling with green gradient

## Key Files Modified

### Backend Logic
- `ShowPayroll.java` - Added overtime type checking and employee state logic
- `PayrollServlet.java` - Added overtime type checking for punch calculations
- `SubscriptionUtils.java` - Pro plan detection utility
- `StateOvertimeRules.java` - State-specific overtime rule definitions

### Frontend Updates
- `settings.jsp` - Added Pro plan overtime type option with conditional display
- `settings.css` - Added Pro badge styling
- `settings.js` - Updated JavaScript for new overtime type handling
- `payroll.js` - Added page refresh on punch edit modal close

### Configuration
- New setting: `OvertimeType` (manual/company_state/employee_state)
- Existing employee `STATE` field used for employee location
- Pro plan detected by `MaxUsers = 100` in tenants table

## Testing Steps

1. **Verify Pro Plan Detection**:
   - Check tenant has `MaxUsers = 100` in database
   - Confirm Pro badge appears in Settings > Overtime section

2. **Test Employee State Overtime**:
   - Set `OvertimeType = "employee_state"` in settings
   - Add employees with different states (CA, AK, NV, CO)
   - Run payroll and verify different overtime calculations per employee

3. **Test Payroll Refresh**:
   - Go to payroll page
   - Click on employee row to open punch editor
   - Make changes and close popup
   - Verify payroll page refreshes automatically

## State Overtime Rules Implemented

- **California**: Daily OT >8hrs, Double time >12hrs, 7th day rules
- **Alaska**: Daily OT >8hrs, 7th day OT
- **Nevada**: Daily OT >8hrs  
- **Colorado**: Daily OT >12hrs
- **All Others**: Standard FLSA (weekly OT >40hrs)

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing customers continue using current overtime settings
- New `OvertimeType` defaults to "manual" (existing behavior)
- Non-Pro plans cannot access employee state option
- All existing overtime configurations preserved

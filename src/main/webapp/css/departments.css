/* v9: Specific styles for departments.jsp, if any, that override reports.css */

/*
    Most styling (page layout, tables, modals, base glossy buttons, text/icon button colors)
    is inherited from css/reports.css by applying common classes in departments.jsp.
*/

/* Example: If the #button-container on departments.jsp specifically needed
   justify-content: flex-start instead of space-around from reports.css: */
/*
#button-container {
    justify-content: flex-start;
    gap: 20px;
}
#button-container button.glossy-button {
    flex-grow: 0;
    flex-shrink: 0;
}
*/

/* Styling for the "To Edit or Delete..." h4 subheading if needed */
/* This is currently styled inline in the JSP, but could be moved here:
.departments-page h4 {
    text-align: left;
    color: #6c757d;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    font-size: 0.9em;
    font-weight: normal;
}
*/

.required-asterisk { /* If not globally defined in reports.css */
    color: #dc3545;
    margin-left: 2px;
    font-weight: bold;
}

/* Add any other styles absolutely unique to departments.jsp elements here. */
/* For now, it remains minimal. */

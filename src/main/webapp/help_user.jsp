            <h2>How Tardies are Calculated</h2>
            <p>Tardies are automatically calculated and tracked by the system to help monitor attendance patterns.</p>
            
            <h3>When Tardies Apply</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Schedule Required:</strong> Tardies are only calculated for employees assigned to a schedule with defined start and end times</li>
                <li><strong>Scheduled Days Only:</strong> You can only be marked tardy on days you are scheduled to work</li>
                <li><strong>No Tardies on Days Off:</strong> If you punch in on your day off or a day you're not scheduled, you cannot accumulate a tardy</li>
                <li><strong>Open Schedules:</strong> Employees on "Open" schedules (no set start/end times) cannot be marked tardy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Grace Period</h3>
            <p>Your company may have set a grace period (typically 5-15 minutes) that allows you to punch in late without being marked tardy. This grace period is factored into all tardy calculations.</p>
            
            <h3>Visual Indicators</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red Highlighting:</strong> Tardy punches will be highlighted in red on your time card</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>Note: Tardies are used for attendance tracking and reporting. Contact your supervisor if you have questions about your company's attendance policy.</em></p>

            <h2>How Overtime is Calculated</h2>
            
            <h3>Overtime Calculation Methods</h3>
            <p>Your overtime calculation depends on your company's subscription plan and configuration settings:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Basic and Business Plans:</strong> Overtime can be calculated using two methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>By Company State:</strong> All employees follow the overtime rules of your company's registered state, regardless of where individual employees are located.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Override:</strong> Your company can set custom overtime rules that override both federal and state calculations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Pro Plan:</strong> Includes all the above options plus:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>By Employee State:</strong> Each employee's overtime is calculated according to the labor laws of the state listed in their employee profile. This ensures compliance with state-specific overtime rules, which can vary significantly. This feature is particularly useful for companies with remote workers or multiple office locations across different states.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Work Week Definition</h3>
            <p>The system calculates overtime based on a 7-day work week period. By default, the work week starts on <strong>Sunday at 12:00 AM</strong> and ends on <strong>Saturday at 11:59 PM</strong>. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hours are counted from Sunday through Saturday for overtime purposes</li>
                <li>Overtime calculations reset each Sunday</li>
                <li>Daily overtime rules (where applicable by state) are calculated within each 24-hour period</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>Note: While it's optional, changing the first day of the work week in Settings is not recommended as it may affect overtime calculations and payroll consistency.</em></p>
            
            <h3>State-Specific Rules</h3>
            <p>Different states have varying overtime requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some states require overtime after 8 hours in a single day (daily overtime)</li>
                <li>Others follow the federal standard of 40 hours per week</li>
                <li>Certain states have different rates for double-time (2x pay) after specific thresholds</li>
                <li>For complete state-by-state overtime rules, visit the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/state" target="_blank">Department of Labor's State Minimum Wage and Overtime Laws</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Calculation Priority</h3>
            <p>When multiple overtime rules apply, the system uses whichever calculation results in the highest pay for the employee, ensuring compliance while maximizing employee compensation.</p>
